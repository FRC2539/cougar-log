See the following page for a guide on creating these files inside of an FRC robotics project: https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/telemetry/datalog.html Quickstart Installation Run the following to install cougar-log using pip: pip install cougar-log Basic Usage Examples See the documentation below this section for more specific capabilities of this CLI. In this example, we have a file in our current directory called my_data_log.wpilog . Converting to CSV cougar-log convert -i my_data_log.wpilog or, to convert any file in the given folder: cougar-log convert -i . Displaying as a Table cougar-log table -i my_data_log.wpilog Graphing Data cougar-log graph -i my_data_log.wpilog Filtering Any of these commands can be used with a filter flag ( -f/--filter ) in order to select only the entries that have that name. Use the table option to see the names of all of the log entries. cougar-log graph -i my_data_log.wpilog -f /temps/drive cougar-log Usage: [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]... Options: --install-completion Install completion for the current shell. --show-completion Show completion for the current shell, to copy it or customize the installation. convert This command will convert a given wpilog file or directory of files into csv files. Optionally use filter to select only log entries containing a given name. Usage: convert [OPTIONS] Options: -i, --input PATH The file/directory provided to convert. -o, --output PATH The name of the resulting file. -f, --filter TEXT Filter by a specific name in the logs. -t, --include-system-time Whether or not to include system time in the output. graph This command will display the contents of a wpilog file in a graph. Optionally use filter to select only logs containing a given name. Usage: graph [OPTIONS] Options: -i, --input PATH The file provided to graph. -f, --filter TEXT Filter by a specific name in the logs. table This command will display the contents of a wpilog file in a table.
